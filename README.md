# Realtime_infractructure_monitoring-and-Recommendation
Overview
Today, each sector, such as education, health, agriculture, etc., is growing at a fast pace, and so is the infrastructure required for each sector. Developing infrastructure for each sector is a huge task and involves huge costs. Currently, a few tools are being used to monitor the day-to-day progress of the infrastructure, but they are all manual. This results in additional costs and the untimely completion of the infrastructural projects.  With geo-tagging and Monitoring , it is possible to identify the chunk of land within the given location, district, town, etc., but the major challenge lies when it comes to the development of infrastructure. Currently, there is no mechanism available to monitor the progress on a real-time basis, so lots of manual intervention happens to monitor the progress. To overcome this issue, it is necessary to develop GIS application through which real-time monitoring of the infrastructure can be done.
